## Rules and Guidelines

1) The objective of the game is to eliminate all of the opponent's pieces before they eliminate all of yours! Players eliminate their opponents pieces by moving their piece over their opponents.

2) Each piece can move one position diagonally forward on each turn with two exceptions;
   
   -- If a player is eliminating their opponent's piece as this would require them to move TWO positions diagonally forward, or,

   -- If a player's piece has reached king status, which allows their piece to move diagonally forward AND backwards.

3) A player's piece reaches king status if it reaches the very opposite end of the game board without being eliminated.

4) During the game random "power-ups" can appear on the board. 

   -- Random addition: When activated, an additional piece of the player's OR opponent's CAN be added to the gameboard at random.

   -- Random elimination: When activated, one of the player's OR opponent's pieces CAN be removed from the gameboard at random.

5) Power-ups are activated when a player moves their piece over the power-up token, similar to the action performed when killing an opponent. Once this power-up is engaged, it will remain in effect until a new power up is activated by another player.
